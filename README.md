Performance Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms (SVM, Random Forest) on Parkinson's Disease Detection
Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that significantly affects motor functions, necessitating early and accurate diagnosis to enable timely interventions. Machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated potential in PD prediction, offering an alternative to traditional diagnostic methods. This project focuses on analyzing the performance of two widely used ML models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), for predicting PD.. This work seeks to identify the most effective algorithm for non-invasive, feature-based PD prediction. The findings will contribute to developing accessible, efficient diagnostic tools for resource-limited settings, enhancing early detection and management of Parkinson's Disease.
